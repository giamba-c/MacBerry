iMac RetroFit: Reusing the Design of the Past

I would like to fit a Raspberry Pi 5 inside an old 2010 iMac. The iMac should remain perfectly identical to the original on the outside, maintaining the classic and iconic design. 
My idea is to open a 2010 iMac, empty it, and reuse only some parts, such as the display, CD drive, speakers, USB ports, power button, cooling system, and power supply with the classic Apple cable. 
After that, I want to insert an SBC (single board computer), in my case a Raspberry Pi 5, close everything up, and install a super light Linux distro on it for various uses. 

So I'm looking for fun people who are willing to dive into this project. 

Here are the points I would like to start addressing:
- Guide to correctly disassemble the iMac without damaging it
- Choosing the parts to reuse and understanding why it is important to keep them
- Designing 3D printable supports that fit the iMac for installing the various components, especially the SBC
- Designing PCBs if necessary for connecting the various devices
- Guide to assemble everything
- Choosing and installing a fast and light distro for home use (internet, mail, video, and music sharing)
- Creating a website
- Sharing the project
